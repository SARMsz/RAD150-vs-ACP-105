<h1>RAD150 vs ACP-105: My Real Experience With These SARMs</h1>

<p>After running cycles with both <strong>RAD150</strong> and <strong>ACP-105</strong>, I can tell you right nowâ€”theyâ€™re not built for the same job. One hits hard for size and strength. The other feels cleaner, easier to recover from, and surprisingly effective for lean mass. If you're choosing between the two, here's exactly what I found out after testing them both myself.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked These SARMs</h2>
<p>I donâ€™t write based on theoryâ€”I run actual cycles. I measure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Muscle gain (with DEXA scans and measurements)</li>
  <li>Strength increases (compound lifts)</li>
  <li>Recovery time</li>
  <li>Sides: suppression, aggression, sleep, libido, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ran both SARMs for 8 weeks, kept diet and training consistent, and didnâ€™t stack with other compounds.</p>

<h2>What Is RAD150?</h2>
<p><strong>RAD150</strong> (also called <strong>TLB-150</strong>) is an esterified version of RAD140. That means it's time-released and more stable. It hits harder and stays active longer in your system. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/rad150-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this RAD150 from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My RAD150 Results</h3>
<p>RAD150 blew me away in terms of strength. By week 3, my bench was up 20 lbs. Pumps were unreal, and I looked full all the time. It felt like testosterone without the bloat.</p>
<p>Muscle gain was very noticeableâ€”about 6 lbs of lean mass in 8 weeks. No crazy water retention. Strength gains were the standout.</p>

<h3>RAD150 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Insane strength boost (compound lifts shot up fast)</li>
  <li>Full, dry muscle look</li>
  <li>No liver toxicity</li>
  <li>Longer half-life = more stable levels</li>
</ul>

<h3>RAD150 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mild testosterone suppression (need mini PCT)</li>
  <li>Some insomnia during week 6â€“8</li>
  <li>Not ideal for cuttingâ€”too anabolic</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, strength cycles, recomposition</h4>

<h2>What Is ACP-105?</h2>
<p><strong>ACP-105</strong> is a next-gen SARM thatâ€™s often compared to S4 (Andarine) but with fewer vision sides. Itâ€™s known for quick lean muscle gains and improved muscle density. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/acp-105-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this ACP-105 from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My ACP-105 Results</h3>
<p>This one surprised me. Itâ€™s not as powerful as RAD150, but for a clean cut or recomp, itâ€™s gold. I dropped fat without changing diet much and gained about 3 lbs of lean muscle. Workouts felt sharp, energy was high, and recovery was fast.</p>
<p>Best part? No suppression for me. No crash after the cycle. I didnâ€™t even need a PCT.</p>

<h3>ACP-105 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clean, dry lean gains</li>
  <li>Boosts endurance and recovery</li>
  <li>Very low suppression</li>
  <li>No liver stress</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACP-105 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not great for heavy bulking</li>
  <li>Gains are slower and more subtle</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, endurance, clean recomp</h4>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>Is RAD150 stronger than ACP-105?</h3>
<p>Yes. RAD150 is way stronger for size and strength. But ACP-105 is cleaner and has fewer side effects.</p>

<h3>Can I stack RAD150 and ACP-105 together?</h3>
<p>Yes, but only if you're experienced. RAD150 can suppress testosterone. Youâ€™ll need a PCT. Start low and monitor closely.</p>

<h3>Do I need a PCT after RAD150?</h3>
<p>Yes. Youâ€™ll want a mini PCT (Clomid or Nolva) after 8 weeks.</p>

<h3>Do I need a PCT after ACP-105?</h3>
<p>Usually not. Itâ€™s very mild. But if you're sensitive or run longer than 8 weeks, consider it.</p>

<h3>Can women take RAD150 or ACP-105?</h3>
<p>ACP-105 is safer for women. RAD150 is too androgenic for most female users.</p>

<h3>How long does it take to see results?</h3>
<p>RAD150: around week 2â€“3. ACP-105: week 3â€“4. Both work faster with dialed-in diet and training.</p>

<h3>Which is better for recomp?</h3>
<p>ACP-105. Cleaner gains, easier on your system, and helps burn fat while preserving muscle.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Both RAD150 and ACP-105 workâ€”but for different goals. Iâ€™ve cycled both solo and tracked every lift, every meal, and every pound. If you're chasing bulk and brute strength, grab <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/rad150-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RAD150 here</a>.
